Dataomaha.com base template
===========================
We've reached the point where a handful of people are developing projects on Dataomaha.com. 
Instead of starting from scratch each time and ending up in a similar place for the basic page structure, let's all start from the same place.
Responsive, simple nav, common fonts. No hassle.
Here's the first attempt at that.
<ol>
<li>Uses Bootstrap 3.0.3, hosted on dataomaha.com</li>
<li>Basic navbar at the top with the Omaha.com logo</li>
<li>Analytics code baked in for Google, Chartbeat and Omniture</li>
</ol>
Available extras

Copy these files into your project if you're just looking for tracking.
<ol>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
<li>Chartbeat</li>
</ol>
