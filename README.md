Dataomaha.com base template
=====
We've reached the point where a handful of people are developing projects on Dataomaha.com. It'd be nice if future iterations adopted a common(-ish) template structure to make initial development easier.
Here's the first attempt at that.
<ol>
<li>Uses Bootstrap 3.0.3, hosted on dataomaha.com</li>
<li>Basic navbar at the top with the Omaha.com logo</li>
<li>Analytics code baked in for Google, Chartbeat and Omniture</li>
</ol>
