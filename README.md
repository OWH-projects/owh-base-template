-Dataomaha.com base template

 ===========================
  
We've reached the point where a handful of people are developing projects on Dataomaha.com. 

Instead of starting from scratch each time and ending up in a similar place for the basic page structure, let's all start from the same place.

Responsive, simple nav, common fonts. No hassle.

Here's the first attempt at that.

<ol>
<li>Uses Bootstrap 3.0.3, hosted on dataomaha.com</li>
<li>Basic navbar at the top with the Omaha.com logo</li>
<li>Analytics code baked in for Google, Chartbeat and Omniture</li>
<li>Ionicons 1.3.0 support</li>
</ol>

Custom styling
---------------

Want to add you own styles? There's a line in the head to define your custom CSS file. ** Don't mess with the original Boostrap files in the Dataomaha.com media folder. **

Available extras
-----------------

Copy these files into your existing project if you're just looking for tracking.
<ol>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
<li>Chartbeat</li>
</ol>
